## Introduction

In this project, we developed a simple password login timer algorithm using JavaScript. The algorithm is designed to give users an idea of the password they choose.

## Question
- According to the button model on the screen, different step distances have been defined. Each of these steps corresponds to a button.
- You reach a location at a distance of 1 step, and this step takes 1 second to complete.
- To reach a location at a distance of 2 steps, it takes 2 seconds.
- When the same button is pressed again, 0 seconds are spent.
- You can design a JavaScript algorithm that performs this operation. This algorithm will calculate the time spent based on the step distance when a button is pressed.
