# Password Strength Estimation Algorithm

This repository contains a JavaScript-based password strength estimation algorithm. The algorithm takes a user-provided password as input and calculates an estimated time in seconds that it would take to crack the password based on certain criteria. The algorithm assesses the strength of the password by analyzing the sequence of characters and their relationships with predefined reference values.

## Introduction

In this project, we've developed a simple password strength estimation algorithm using JavaScript. The algorithm is designed to give users an idea of how secure their chosen password is against potential attacks.

## Question
- According to the button model on the screen, different step distances have been defined. Each of these steps corresponds to a button.
- You reach a location at a distance of 1 step, and this step takes 1 second to complete.
- To reach a location at a distance of 2 steps, it takes 2 seconds.
- When the same button is pressed again, 0 seconds are spent.
- You can design a JavaScript algorithm that performs this operation. This algorithm will calculate the time spent based on the step distance when a button is pressed.
